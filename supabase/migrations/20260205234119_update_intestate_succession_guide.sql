SET content = '[{"type":"paragraph","content":"When an Illinois resident dies without a valid will or trust, their estate passes according to the state''s intestate succession laws. Understanding these rules is critical for anyone who wants to ensure their assets are distributed according to their wishes, rather than a predetermined legal formula. Illinois intestate succession is governed by the Illinois Probate Act, specifically <strong>755 ILCS 5/2-1</strong>, which establishes a strict hierarchy of beneficiaries based on family relationships. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how intestate succession works in Illinois, who inherits what under various scenarios, and why proper estate planning can help you avoid the limitations and complications of dying intestate."},{"type":"heading","content":"What Is Intestate Succession?","level":2,"id":"what-is-intestate-succession"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Intestate succession refers to the legal process that determines how a deceased person''s property is distributed when they die without a valid <a href=\"/chicago-wills-lawyer\">will</a> or other estate planning documents. The term \"intestate\" literally means \"without a testament\" or will. When someone dies intestate in Illinois, the state steps in with a default plan that distributes assets based on family relationships. This statutory scheme applies regardless of what the deceased person might have wanted or what their family members believe is fair. The intestacy laws are designed to approximate what most people would want, favoring spouses and close blood relatives, but they cannot account for individual circumstances, blended families, or personal preferences."},{"type":"callout","variant":"warning","title":"Intestacy Applies Only to Probate Assets","content":"It''s important to understand that intestate succession laws only govern <strong>probate assets</strong>\u2014property held solely in the deceased person''s name without a designated beneficiary.

The primary statute, 755 ILCS 5/2-1, lays out the distribution scheme based on which relatives survive the decedent. The law establishes a clear hierarchy: surviving spouse first, then descendants (children, grandchildren), then parents, then siblings, and so on through more distant relatives. If absolutely no relatives can be found, the estate escheats to the state of Illinois. The Illinois rules have some unique features that differ from other states, particularly in how they treat spouses when there are also descendants, and in the treatment of certain types of children and relatives."},{"type":"statute-reference","content":"\"If there is a surviving spouse and also a descendant of the decedent: 1/2 of the entire estate to the surviving spouse and 1/2 to the decedent''s descendants per stirpes.

The key question is whether all of the decedent''s descendants are also descendants of the surviving spouse. If <strong>all descendants are children of both the decedent and the surviving spouse</strong>, the surviving spouse inherits the entire estate. This rule recognizes that in traditional nuclear families, the surviving spouse will typically provide for the mutual children. However, if <strong>any descendant is not also a descendant of the surviving spouse</strong>\u2014such as a child from a previous relationship\u2014then the estate is split 50/50 between the surviving spouse and all of the decedent''s descendants per stirpes. This protects children from prior relationships who might otherwise be disinherited."},{"type":"callout","variant":"important","title":"Blended Families Face Complex Issues","content":"The 50/50 split rule can create unexpected results in blended families. For example, if you have three children from a first marriage and remarry, your new spouse would receive only half of your intestate estate, with the other half divided among your children. If you have minor children from your first marriage, this could mean your current spouse has insufficient resources while also potentially needing to interact with your children or their guardians regarding estate administration. Proper estate planning with a <a href=\"/chicago-wills-lawyer\">will</a> or <a href=\"/chicago-revocable-trusts-lawyer\">trust</a> can address these issues directly."},{"type":"heading","content":"Understanding Per Stirpes Distribution","level":2,"id":"per-stirpes-distribution"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Illinois uses \"per stirpes\" distribution when dividing assets among descendants. Per stirpes is a Latin term meaning \"by branch\" or \"by roots.\" Under this method, if a child of the decedent has predeceased but left their own children (the decedent''s grandchildren), those grandchildren step into their parent''s shoes and collectively receive the share their parent would have received. This ensures that each family branch receives an equal portion. For example, if you die with two children, one living and one deceased, and the deceased child left three grandchildren, your estate would be divided in half: 50% to your living child and 50% divided equally among the three grandchildren (16.67% each). This differs from \"per capita\" distribution, which some states use, where all living members of the same generation share equally."},{"type":"tabs","title":"Per Stirpes Distribution Examples","items":[{"label":"Example 1: All Children Living","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> John dies intestate with no spouse but three living children: Amy, Bob, and Carol.<br><br><strong>Distribution:</strong> The estate is divided equally among the three children. Amy receives 1/3, Bob receives 1/3, and Carol receives 1/3. This is straightforward as all children are living and distribution occurs at the first generational level."},{"label":"Example 2: One Deceased Child","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> Sarah dies intestate with no spouse and three children: David (living), Ellen (living), and Frank (deceased). Frank had two children of his own, George and Hannah.<br><br><strong>Distribution:</strong> The estate is divided into three equal shares at the children''s level. David receives 1/3, Ellen receives 1/3, and Frank''s 1/3 share is divided between his two children. George receives 1/6 and Hannah receives 1/6. The grandchildren receive their deceased parent''s share by representation."},{"label":"Example 3: Multiple Deceased Children","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> Robert dies intestate with no spouse and four children: Isabel (living with no children), Jack (deceased, who had one child, Kevin), Laura (deceased, who had three children: Mark, Nancy, and Olivia), and Peter (living with two children).<br><br><strong>Distribution:</strong> The estate divides into four equal shares at the children''s level. Isabel receives 1/4. Jack''s 1/4 goes entirely to Kevin. Laura''s 1/4 is split three ways among Mark (1/12), Nancy (1/12), and Olivia (1/12). Peter receives 1/4 (his living children don''t inherit because Peter is alive to receive his share)."},{"label":"Example 4: No Living Children","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> Margaret dies intestate with no spouse and no living children. Her two children both predeceased her. Child 1 had two children (Grandchildren A and B), and Child 2 had one child (Grandchild C).<br><br><strong>Distribution:</strong> Even though all beneficiaries are grandchildren, distribution still follows per stirpes from the children''s generation. The estate divides in half. Grandchildren A and B together receive 1/2 (so 1/4 each), and Grandchild C receives the other 1/2. Per stirpes can result in unequal shares among the same generational level, as it respects the family branch structure."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Who Qualifies as a Surviving Spouse?","level":2,"id":"surviving-spouse-definition"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"To inherit as a surviving spouse under Illinois intestacy laws, the couple must have been legally married at the time of death. This includes same-sex marriages, which Illinois has recognized since 2014. However, several situations can affect whether someone qualifies as a surviving spouse. If the couple was legally divorced before death, the former spouse has no inheritance rights. If divorce proceedings were pending but not finalized, the person generally still qualifies as a surviving spouse. Illinois also recognizes common law marriages that were validly created in other states that allow common law marriage, though Illinois itself does not allow creation of new common law marriages. A spouse who abandoned the decedent or was found to be at fault in certain ways may be barred from inheritance under specific circumstances."},{"type":"statute-reference","content":"\"A surviving spouse who has forfeited the right to inherit from the deceased spouse under Section 2-6.2 of this Act shall not be entitled to an intestate share of the estate.\"","source":"755 ILCS 5/2-1 (Note: Section 2-6.2 addresses forfeiture due to abandonment or lack of support)"},{"type":"heading","content":"Children''s Rights: Biological, Adopted, and Stepchildren","level":2,"id":"childrens-rights-illinois"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Illinois intestacy law treats various categories of children differently, and understanding these distinctions is crucial for predicting how an estate will be distributed."},{"type":"accordion","items":[{"title":"Biological Children","content":"All biological children of the decedent inherit equally under intestacy laws, regardless of whether the parents were married when the child was born. Children born outside of marriage have the same inheritance rights as children born during marriage. The child must be able to prove the parent-child relationship, which is generally straightforward if the decedent is the mother but may require additional evidence if the decedent is the father, such as a paternity test, acknowledgment of paternity, or legal determination of parentage."},{"title":"Legally Adopted Children","content":"Children who are legally adopted have the exact same inheritance rights as biological children under Illinois law. Once an adoption is finalized, the adopted child is treated as a natural child of the adoptive parents for all purposes, including intestate succession. Conversely, adoption <strong>severs</strong> the legal relationship with the biological parents (except in stepparent adoptions), meaning adopted children generally do not inherit from their biological parents'' intestate estates."},{"title":"Stepchildren and Foster Children","content":"Stepchildren and foster children have <strong>no automatic inheritance rights</strong> under Illinois intestacy laws unless they have been legally adopted by the stepparent or foster parent. Many people mistakenly assume that long-term stepparent-stepchild relationships create inheritance rights, but this is not the case. If you want your stepchildren or foster children to inherit from your estate, you must specifically name them in a <a href=\"/chicago-wills-lawyer\">will</a> or include them as beneficiaries in a <a href=\"/chicago-revocable-trusts-lawyer\">trust</a>. This is one of the most common estate planning oversights in blended families."},{"title":"Children Born After Death (Posthumous Children)","content":"Children who are conceived before the decedent''s death but born afterward (posthumous children) are treated as having been born during the decedent''s lifetime and have full inheritance rights. Illinois law protects these children to ensure they receive their intestate share. The calculation and distribution may be delayed until the child is born, but they are entitled to inherit as if they had been born before the parent''s death."},{"title":"Children Conceived Through Assisted Reproduction After Death","content":"Illinois law addresses the increasingly common situation of children conceived using assisted reproductive technology after a parent''s death. Under 755 ILCS 5/2-3, a child conceived using genetic material from a deceased parent may inherit if certain conditions are met: the deceased parent consented in writing to posthumous conception and to the child''s inheritance rights, and the child is in utero within 36 months of the parent''s death or born within 45 months of the parent''s death. Without clear written consent, these children may not be able to inherit through intestacy."},{"title":"Half-Siblings vs. Whole Siblings","content":"When inheritance passes to the decedent''s siblings (because there is no surviving spouse, descendants, or parents), Illinois law treats half-siblings and whole siblings equally. Half-siblings\u2014those who share only one parent with the decedent\u2014receive the same share as whole siblings who share both parents. This equal treatment applies whether the shared parent is the mother or father. Some states give half-siblings a reduced share, but Illinois does not make this distinction."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Unique Illinois Intestacy Rules","level":2,"id":"unique-illinois-rules"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"While intestacy laws share common features across states, Illinois has several distinctive rules and approaches that set it apart from other jurisdictions. Understanding these unique provisions is essential for Illinois residents and for attorneys practicing in the state."},{"type":"numbered-steps","items":[{"title":"All-to-Spouse Rule for Same-Descendant Families","content":"Illinois gives the entire estate to the surviving spouse if all of the decedent''s descendants are also descendants of that spouse. Many states divide the estate between spouse and children regardless of whether the children are mutual. This Illinois rule recognizes the reality that in intact nuclear families, the surviving spouse will naturally provide for mutual children. However, this makes Illinois law particularly complex in blended family situations."},{"title":"Extended Posthumous Conception Window","content":"Illinois provides one of the more generous timeframes in the nation for posthumously conceived children to qualify for inheritance: the child must be in utero within 36 months or born within 45 months of the parent''s death. Many states have much shorter windows or don''t address this issue at all. However, Illinois also requires explicit written consent from the deceased parent."},{"title":"Grandparents and More Distant Relatives","content":"If the estate passes beyond siblings, Illinois divides the estate between the maternal and paternal grandparents or their descendants. The estate is split 50/50 between the two sides of the family, even if one side has many relatives and the other has only one. If an entire side has no surviving members, the whole estate goes to the other side."},{"title":"No Inheritance for Non-Relatives","content":"Illinois is strict about the requirement of a blood or legal relationship. Unmarried partners, no matter how long the relationship, have no inheritance rights under intestacy laws. Friends, caregivers, and non-legal family members also cannot inherit through intestacy. If no relatives can be found, the entire estate escheats to the State of Illinois. This underscores the importance of having a <a href=\"/chicago-wills-lawyer\">will</a> if you want anyone outside your legal family to inherit."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"The Probate Process for Intestate Estates","level":2,"id":"probate-process-intestate"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When someone dies intestate in Illinois, their estate must generally go through probate court proceedings. The court will appoint an administrator (rather than an executor named in a will) to manage the estate. This person is typically a close family member, often the surviving spouse or an adult child. The administrator must identify and collect all probate assets, pay valid debts and taxes, and distribute the remaining assets according to the intestacy statutes. The process can take anywhere from several months to over a year, depending on the complexity of the estate and whether any disputes arise. Dying intestate can make the probate process more complicated and expensive than it needs to be, as there is no clear statement of the decedent''s wishes and no named executor with authority to act immediately."},{"type":"heading","content":"Problems and Complications of Dying Intestate","level":2,"id":"problems-dying-intestate"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"While intestacy laws provide a default plan, dying without a will creates numerous problems and limitations that proper estate planning can avoid. The intestacy formula cannot account for your individual circumstances, wishes, or family dynamics. Some of the most common problems include: unintended beneficiaries receiving assets (or intended beneficiaries receiving nothing), minor children receiving large inheritances without proper management structures, inability to minimize estate taxes, no ability to name guardians for minor children, potential family conflicts over who should serve as administrator, delay and expense in the probate process, and no ability to leave specific items to specific people.
