The tax is imposed on the transfer of the <em>entire taxable estate</em>, not just the amount exceeding the exemption. This is an important distinction: once an estate crosses the $4 million threshold, the entire estate is subject to tax, though a credit effectively shelters the first $4 million. The tax is calculated using a graduated rate structure, and the estate\u2019s personal representative (executor) is responsible for filing the Illinois estate tax return and paying any tax due."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Illinois estate tax is calculated based on the maximum state death tax credit that was allowed under the federal estate tax law as it existed in 2001, before the federal credit was phased out. This means Illinois uses a specific formula tied to the pre-2001 federal credit table rather than a simple flat percentage. The effective tax rates range from approximately <strong>0.8% to 16%</strong>, depending on the size of the estate, though most estates pay effective rates between 4% and 10%."},{"type":"statute-reference","content":"The Illinois estate tax is imposed on the transfer of the taxable estate of every resident and nonresident decedent whose federal gross estate exceeds $4,000,000.

This means that when the first spouse dies, their $4 million Illinois exemption is lost forever unless their estate plan is specifically structured to preserve it (typically through a credit shelter or bypass trust). A married couple without proper planning effectively loses $4 million of combined exemption, potentially resulting in hundreds of thousands of dollars in unnecessary tax. This is one of the most common and costly estate planning mistakes for Illinois families."},{"type":"heading","content":"Who Is Subject to Illinois Estate Tax?","level":2,"id":"who-is-subject"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Illinois estate tax applies to two categories of decedents: <strong>Illinois residents</strong> whose worldwide gross estate exceeds $4 million, and <strong>non-residents</strong> who own real estate or tangible personal property located in Illinois and whose total gross estate exceeds $4 million. For residents, all assets wherever located are included in the gross estate. For non-residents, the tax applies only to the Illinois-situated property, but the calculation still considers the total gross estate."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The gross estate for Illinois purposes generally mirrors the federal gross estate and includes all property owned at death plus certain transfers made during life (such as assets in revocable trusts, life insurance proceeds where the decedent held incidents of ownership, jointly held property, and certain transfers made within three years of death). It is not unusual for estates to exceed $4 million when you include the family home, retirement accounts, life insurance death benefits, investment accounts, and other assets."},{"type":"tabs","title":"Common Assets That Count Toward the $4 Million Threshold","items":[{"label":"Real Estate","content":"Your primary residence, vacation homes, rental properties, and any other real estate you own are included at their fair market value on the date of death. In the Chicago metropolitan area, a single-family home can account for a significant portion of the $4 million threshold. If property has appreciated substantially since purchase, the estate tax value may surprise your family. Land contracts and partnership interests holding real estate are also included."},{"label":"Retirement Accounts","content":"All retirement accounts\u2014including IRAs, 401(k)s, 403(b)s, SEP-IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, and pension benefits\u2014are included in the gross estate at their full value on the date of death. These accounts often represent the largest single asset in an estate, especially for individuals who have been saving throughout their career. Note that while retirement accounts are included in the taxable estate, they are also subject to income tax when distributed to beneficiaries, creating potential <strong>double taxation</strong> that requires coordinated planning."},{"label":"Life Insurance","content":"Life insurance death benefits are included in the gross estate if the decedent owned the policy or held any <em>incidents of ownership</em> (such as the right to change beneficiaries, borrow against the policy, or cancel the policy). A $1 million life insurance policy can push an otherwise non-taxable estate over the $4 million threshold. <strong>Irrevocable life insurance trusts (ILITs)</strong> can remove life insurance proceeds from the taxable estate, but the trust must be properly structured and the policy must be transferred more than three years before death."},{"label":"Investment & Bank Accounts","content":"All individually owned or jointly held bank accounts, brokerage accounts, certificates of deposit, mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and other financial instruments are included at their date-of-death value. For jointly owned accounts with a spouse, typically 50% is included. For accounts jointly held with non-spouses, the full value may be included unless the co-owner can prove their contribution."},{"label":"Business Interests","content":"Ownership interests in LLCs, partnerships, S corporations, C corporations, and sole proprietorships are all included in the gross estate. Valuation of closely held business interests can be complex and may involve discounts for lack of marketability and minority interest positions, but the full fair market value is the starting point. Business succession planning and buy-sell agreements funded with life insurance can help provide liquidity to pay estate taxes without forcing a sale of the business."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Illinois Estate Tax Rates and Calculations","level":2,"id":"tax-rates-calculations"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Illinois estate tax rate structure is graduated, meaning larger estates pay higher effective rates. The tax is calculated using the former federal state death tax credit table from IRC Section 2011 as it existed before 2002.

An estate valued at $4,000,001 immediately owes approximately $15,000\u2013$20,000 in tax. This cliff effect means that estates near the $4 million threshold can achieve dramatic tax savings by reducing the taxable estate even slightly below the exemption amount through gifting, charitable contributions, or other strategies."},{"type":"heading","content":"Filing Requirements and Deadlines","level":2,"id":"filing-requirements"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The executor or personal representative of the estate is responsible for determining whether an Illinois estate tax return is required and for timely filing and payment."},{"type":"numbered-steps","items":[{"title":"Determine If Filing Is Required","content":"An Illinois estate tax return is required if the decedent was an Illinois resident with a gross estate exceeding $4 million, or a non-resident with Illinois-situated property and a total gross estate exceeding $4 million. Even if the marital deduction or other deductions reduce the taxable estate below $4 million, the return must still be filed if the gross estate exceeds the threshold."},{"title":"File the Illinois Estate Tax Return","content":"The Illinois estate tax return must be filed with the Illinois Attorney General\u2019s Office within <strong>9 months</strong> of the date of death. The return is filed using Form 700, the Illinois Estate and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return. If a federal estate tax return (Form 706) is required, the Illinois return should be consistent with the federal return."},{"title":"Request an Extension If Needed","content":"A 6-month extension is available by filing a request with the Attorney General\u2019s Office before the original due date. However, an extension of time to file is <strong>not</strong> an extension of time to pay. Interest accrues on any unpaid tax from the original due date, so estimated payment should be made with the extension request."},{"title":"Pay the Tax Due","content":"The estate tax must be paid from the estate\u2019s assets. The executor should ensure sufficient liquid assets are available to cover the tax. If the estate lacks liquidity (for example, if it consists primarily of real estate or business interests), the executor may need to sell assets or arrange financing. Illinois does allow installment payments in certain limited circumstances for estates consisting largely of closely held business interests."},{"title":"Obtain the Estate Tax Closing Letter","content":"After the return is reviewed and any tax is paid, the Attorney General\u2019s Office issues a closing letter confirming the estate\u2019s tax obligations have been satisfied. This letter is often required to finalize the probate proceeding and transfer title to real estate. Delays in obtaining the closing letter can hold up estate administration."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Strategies to Minimize Illinois Estate Tax","level":2,"id":"strategies-minimize-tax"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Effective estate tax planning can significantly reduce or even eliminate Illinois estate tax liability. The best approach depends on your specific circumstances, including the size of your estate, family structure, charitable goals, and risk tolerance. Here are the most common and effective strategies used by Illinois estate planning attorneys."},{"type":"accordion","items":[{"title":"Credit Shelter (Bypass) Trusts for Married Couples","content":"Because Illinois does not offer portability of the estate tax exemption between spouses, a <strong>credit shelter trust</strong> (also called a bypass trust or B trust) is essential for married couples with combined estates over $4 million. When the first spouse dies, up to $4 million is placed in an irrevocable trust that benefits the surviving spouse during their lifetime but is not included in the surviving spouse\u2019s taxable estate at their death. This effectively preserves both spouses\u2019 $4 million exemptions, sheltering up to <strong>$8 million</strong> from Illinois estate tax. Without this trust, the first spouse\u2019s exemption is wasted because all assets pass to the surviving spouse (tax-free via the marital deduction) and are then taxed in the surviving spouse\u2019s estate with only one $4 million exemption. A <a href=\"/chicago-revocable-trusts-lawyer\">revocable living trust</a> is typically used to fund the credit shelter trust at the first death."},{"title":"Lifetime Gifting Strategies","content":"Annual gifts up to the federal gift tax exclusion amount ($19,000 per recipient in 2025) are not included in the taxable estate for Illinois estate tax purposes. A married couple can gift $38,000 per year to each child, grandchild, or other recipient without reducing their estate. Over time, a systematic gifting program can transfer substantial wealth out of the taxable estate. For example, a couple with three children and six grandchildren could transfer $342,000 per year tax-free. Additionally, gifts paid directly to educational institutions for tuition or to medical providers for medical expenses are not subject to gift tax limits and do not count against the exemption."},{"title":"Irrevocable Life Insurance Trusts (ILITs)","content":"Life insurance proceeds are included in the taxable estate if the decedent owned the policy. By transferring ownership of life insurance policies to an <strong>irrevocable life insurance trust (ILIT)</strong>, the death benefit is removed from the taxable estate. The ILIT must be established and the policy transferred (or new policy purchased by the trust) at least <strong>three years</strong> before death for the exclusion to apply. ILITs can also provide liquidity to pay estate taxes on other assets without the life insurance itself being taxed. This strategy is particularly effective for individuals whose estates are near or above the $4 million threshold primarily because of life insurance."},{"title":"Charitable Planning","content":"Charitable bequests are fully deductible for Illinois estate tax purposes. Leaving assets to qualified charitable organizations reduces the taxable estate dollar-for-dollar. More sophisticated strategies include <strong>charitable remainder trusts (CRTs)</strong>, which provide income to family members for a period and then pass the remainder to charity, and <strong>charitable lead trusts (CLTs)</strong>, which provide income to charity for a period and then pass assets to family members at a reduced transfer tax cost. Donor-advised funds and private foundations are also effective tools for individuals with significant charitable intent."},{"title":"Qualified Personal Residence Trusts (QPRTs)","content":"A QPRT allows you to transfer your home to an irrevocable trust while retaining the right to live in it for a specified term of years. At the end of the term, the home passes to your beneficiaries. The gift tax value of the transfer is significantly less than the home\u2019s fair market value because of the retained interest. If you survive the term, the home (and all subsequent appreciation) is removed from your taxable estate. QPRTs are most effective when the homeowner is relatively young, the retained term is moderate (10\u201315 years), and the home has significant value or appreciation potential."},{"title":"Family Limited Partnerships and LLCs","content":"Transferring assets to a family limited partnership (FLP) or LLC and then gifting limited partnership or membership interests to family members can reduce the taxable estate through <strong>valuation discounts</strong>. Because limited interests lack control and marketability, they can be valued at 20\u201335% less than the underlying asset value for gift and estate tax purposes. However, the IRS scrutinizes these arrangements closely, and they must have legitimate non-tax business purposes, proper documentation, and ongoing operational formalities. When properly structured, FLPs and LLCs can be powerful estate tax reduction tools."},{"title":"Spousal Lifetime Access Trusts (SLATs)","content":"A SLAT allows one spouse to create an irrevocable trust for the benefit of the other spouse (and potentially children). Assets transferred to the SLAT are removed from the grantor spouse\u2019s taxable estate, but the beneficiary spouse can access trust funds if needed. This provides a safety net while still achieving estate tax reduction. Couples often create reciprocal SLATs, though care must be taken to avoid the \u201creciprocal trust doctrine,\u201d which could invalidate the tax benefits if the trusts are too similar."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Planning for Estates Near the $4 Million Threshold","level":2,"id":"planning-near-threshold"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Estates valued between $3.5 million and $5 million require particularly careful planning because of the cliff effect. Even modest reductions in the taxable estate can yield outsized tax savings. For estates just above $4 million, simple strategies like annual gifting, prepaying medical or educational expenses for family members, or making charitable contributions can bring the estate below the exemption threshold and eliminate Illinois estate tax entirely."},{"type":"callout","variant":"tip","title":"The Power of Small Reductions Near the Threshold","content":"If your estate is valued at $4.2 million, you face approximately $35,000\u201340,000 in Illinois estate tax. By gifting just $200,000 to family members or charity (which could be done through annual exclusion gifts over a few years), you eliminate the entire tax. For estates at $4.5 million, the tax is approximately $64,000\u2014a systematic gifting program started 3\u20135 years in advance could reduce the estate below the threshold and save the full amount. Starting early gives you the most flexibility and the greatest potential savings."},{"type":"heading","content":"Illinois Estate Tax and Non-Residents","level":2,"id":"non-residents"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Non-residents of Illinois who own real estate or tangible personal property located in Illinois may be subject to Illinois estate tax on those assets. The tax is calculated by first determining the tax on the entire estate as if the decedent were an Illinois resident, and then apportioning that tax based on the ratio of Illinois property to the total gross estate. This means that even relatively modest Illinois real property holdings can trigger a filing requirement and tax liability if the overall estate exceeds $4 million."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For non-residents who own Illinois real estate, transferring the property to a <a href=\"/chicago-revocable-trusts-lawyer\">revocable living trust</a> does not avoid Illinois estate tax (the trust assets are still included in the gross estate), but it can help avoid Illinois <em>probate</em> proceedings. True estate tax reduction for non-residents typically requires removing the Illinois property from the estate entirely, such as through lifetime gifts or business entity structures."},{"type":"heading","content":"Interaction with Federal Estate Tax","level":2,"id":"interaction-federal-tax"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For estates large enough to owe both federal and Illinois estate taxes, the Illinois tax paid is deductible on the federal estate tax return as a state death tax deduction. This means the combined effective rate is lower than the sum of the two rates. Planning must consider both tax regimes simultaneously. Strategies that reduce Illinois estate tax may not reduce federal estate tax (and vice versa), so coordinated planning is essential. Additionally, the federal estate tax exemption is scheduled to decrease significantly in 2026 (to approximately $7 million per person, adjusted for inflation) when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions sunset, which would make federal estate tax planning relevant to many more families."},{"type":"callout","variant":"warning","title":"Federal Exemption Sunset in 2026","content":"The current federal estate tax exemption of approximately $13.99 million per person is set to expire at the end of 2025 under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act sunset provisions. Unless Congress acts, the exemption will revert to approximately $7 million (indexed for inflation). This change would make both federal and Illinois estate tax planning critical for a much larger number of families.

However, any real estate or tangible personal property you still own in Illinois would remain subject to Illinois estate tax as a non-resident. Changing domicile requires more than simply moving\u2014you must demonstrate intent to make the new state your permanent home through actions such as registering to vote, obtaining a new driver\u2019s license, updating your address on all documents, filing tax returns in the new state, and spending the majority of your time there. Illinois may challenge a domicile change if significant connections to the state remain."},{"title":"Does Illinois estate tax apply to assets in a revocable trust?","content":"Yes. Assets in a revocable living trust are included in the gross estate for Illinois estate tax purposes because the grantor retained the right to revoke or amend the trust during their lifetime. The trust avoids <em>probate</em>, not <em>estate tax</em>. To remove assets from the taxable estate, they must be transferred to an <strong>irrevocable</strong> trust or gifted outright, and the grantor must give up all control over the assets."},{"title":"Is the Illinois estate tax exemption amount likely to change?","content":"The $4 million exemption has been in place since 2013 and is not indexed for inflation. Legislative proposals to increase the exemption have been introduced periodically but have not passed. Given Illinois\u2019s fiscal challenges, an increase is not considered likely in the near term. Estate planning should be based on the current $4 million threshold while maintaining flexibility to adjust if the law changes."},{"title":"What happens if I own property in multiple states?","content":"Each state can impose its own estate tax on property located within its borders. If you are an Illinois resident who owns property in another state that also imposes an estate tax, you may owe estate tax to both states on overlapping assets. Illinois provides a credit for estate tax paid to other states on the same property, which helps avoid double taxation, but the credit is limited. Conversely, non-residents owning Illinois property owe Illinois estate tax on those assets even if their home state also taxes their entire estate."},{"title":"How does the marital deduction work for Illinois estate tax?","content":"The unlimited marital deduction allows assets passing to a surviving spouse to be exempt from estate tax at the first death. However, this merely <em>defers</em> the tax\u2014those assets will be included in the surviving spouse\u2019s estate at their death.
