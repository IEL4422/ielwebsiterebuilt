SET content = '[{"type":"paragraph","content":"A living will\u2014formally known in Illinois as a <strong>Declaration</strong> under the Illinois Living Will Act\u2014is a legal document that allows you to express your wishes regarding life-sustaining medical treatment in the event you are diagnosed with a terminal condition or are in a state of permanent unconsciousness and can no longer communicate your decisions. While often confused with a last will and testament, a living will has nothing to do with property distribution. Instead, it provides critical guidance to your doctors, family members, and healthcare agents about the type of medical care you want\u2014or don\u2019t want\u2014when you are unable to speak for yourself."},{"type":"heading","content":"What Is a Living Will Under Illinois Law?","level":2,"id":"what-is-living-will"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The Illinois Living Will Act (755 ILCS 35/) establishes the legal framework for living wills in the state. Under this statute, any competent adult (age 18 or older and of sound mind) may execute a declaration directing that death-delaying procedures be withheld or withdrawn if they are diagnosed with a terminal condition. The statute provides a specific form, though individuals may customize their declarations to address their particular wishes. A living will in Illinois becomes operative when two conditions are met simultaneously: the patient has a qualifying medical condition (terminal illness or permanent unconsciousness) and the patient is unable to communicate their own treatment decisions."},{"type":"statute-reference","content":"Any person of sound mind who has reached the age of majority may execute a declaration directing that if the declarant should have a terminal condition, death-delaying procedures shall be withdrawn or withheld from the declarant in accordance with the provisions of this Act.","source":"755 ILCS 35/3 \u2014 Illinois Living Will Act"},{"type":"callout","variant":"info","title":"Living Will vs. Healthcare Power of Attorney","content":"A living will and a <a href=\"/chicago-healthcare-directives-lawyer\">healthcare power of attorney</a> are complementary but distinct documents. A living will provides <strong>specific instructions</strong> about end-of-life care that take effect only in terminal or permanently unconscious conditions. A healthcare power of attorney designates a <strong>person</strong> (your agent) to make healthcare decisions on your behalf for <em>any</em> medical situation where you cannot communicate. Most estate planning attorneys recommend having both documents to provide the broadest possible protection."},{"type":"heading","content":"When Does a Living Will Take Effect?","level":2,"id":"when-takes-effect"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A living will does not take effect immediately upon signing. It remains dormant until specific medical conditions are met. Understanding these activation requirements is essential to knowing what your living will can and cannot do."},{"type":"numbered-steps","items":[{"title":"You Must Have a Qualifying Medical Condition","content":"The living will applies only when you have been diagnosed with a <strong>terminal condition</strong> (an illness or injury from which there is no reasonable prospect of recovery and which, without life-sustaining treatment, would result in death within a relatively short time) or a state of <strong>permanent unconsciousness</strong> (a condition in which thought, sensation, purposeful behavior, and awareness of self and environment are absent, with no reasonable possibility of recovery)."},{"title":"The Diagnosis Must Be Confirmed by Your Attending Physician","content":"Your attending physician must determine that you have a qualifying terminal condition or are permanently unconscious. In most cases, this diagnosis should be confirmed by at least one additional physician to ensure accuracy. The determination must be documented in your medical record before the living will can be acted upon."},{"title":"You Must Be Unable to Communicate Your Own Decisions","content":"The living will activates only when you cannot make or communicate your own treatment decisions. If you are conscious, competent, and able to express your wishes\u2014even if you have a terminal condition\u2014your direct communications take precedence over any written directive. The living will serves as your voice when you can no longer speak for yourself."},{"title":"Your Healthcare Team Must Be Aware of the Declaration","content":"For your living will to be followed, your healthcare providers must know it exists. Ensure copies are provided to your primary care physician, your hospital (if admitted), your healthcare power of attorney agent, and close family members. Many people also register their living will with the Illinois Secretary of State\u2019s Advance Directive Registry, which provides 24/7 electronic access for healthcare providers."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"What a Living Will Can and Cannot Cover","level":2,"id":"what-living-will-covers"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Illinois law allows you to specify your wishes about several categories of medical treatment. Understanding what you can address in your living will helps you make informed decisions about each element of your end-of-life care."},{"type":"tabs","title":"Treatment Decisions You Can Address","items":[{"label":"Life-Sustaining Treatment","content":"<strong>What it includes:</strong> Mechanical ventilation (breathing machines), dialysis, surgery performed to extend life rather than cure, blood transfusions, administration of antibiotics or other medications intended to keep you alive rather than provide comfort, and similar interventions.<br><br><strong>Your options:</strong> You can direct that all life-sustaining treatments be withheld or withdrawn if you have a terminal condition, or you can specify that certain treatments should continue while others are stopped. For example, you might choose to decline mechanical ventilation but accept antibiotics for comfort."},{"label":"Artificial Nutrition and Hydration","content":"<strong>What it includes:</strong> Tube feeding (nasogastric tube, PEG tube) and intravenous fluids administered to sustain life when you cannot eat or drink on your own.<br><br><strong>Your options:</strong> You can specifically address whether you want artificial nutrition and hydration to be continued or withdrawn. This is often the most emotionally difficult decision in a living will. Illinois law treats this as a separate decision point, and many standard forms include specific language addressing it. Some people choose to allow hydration for comfort while declining tube feeding, or to accept both for a limited period before withdrawal."},{"label":"Pain Management and Comfort Care","content":"<strong>What it includes:</strong> Administration of medications to relieve pain, anxiety, and discomfort; provision of personal care and hygiene; environmental comfort measures; emotional and spiritual support.<br><br><strong>Your options:</strong> You can direct that comfort care continue even if you decline all other treatment. In fact, comfort care is almost always continued regardless of other directives. You may also specify that you want maximum pain relief even if it may hasten death (known as the principle of <em>double effect</em>). Illinois law supports the provision of palliative care alongside directives to withdraw life-sustaining treatment."},{"label":"CPR and Resuscitation","content":"<strong>What it includes:</strong> Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), defibrillation, intubation, and other emergency measures to restart the heart or breathing.<br><br><strong>Your options:</strong> You can indicate whether you want CPR attempted or a <strong>Do Not Resuscitate (DNR)</strong> order. Note that a living will alone may not be sufficient for emergency personnel to honor a DNR request in out-of-hospital settings. Illinois recognizes a separate <strong>POLST (Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment)</strong> form that creates actionable medical orders recognized by paramedics and emergency responders. If you want to ensure DNR wishes are followed in an emergency, discuss a POLST with your physician."},{"label":"Organ and Tissue Donation","content":"<strong>What it includes:</strong> Your wishes regarding donation of organs, tissues, or your body for transplantation, research, or education after death.<br><br><strong>Your options:</strong> While technically separate from the living will, many people include their organ donation preferences in their advance directive documents. Illinois allows organ donation designation through the Secretary of State (driver\u2019s license) and through advance directive documents. Note that if you wish to be an organ donor, certain life-sustaining treatments may need to continue temporarily to preserve organ viability, and your living will should account for this if organ donation is important to you."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"How to Create a Valid Living Will in Illinois","level":2,"id":"how-to-create"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Creating a legally valid living will in Illinois requires following specific statutory requirements. While the process is not complicated, attention to detail ensures your document will be honored when needed."},{"type":"numbered-steps","items":[{"title":"Reflect on Your Values and Wishes","content":"Before putting anything in writing, take time to consider what quality of life means to you, what medical conditions you would find unacceptable, whether your religious or spiritual beliefs influence your views on end-of-life care, and what you have seen in family members\u2019 or friends\u2019 end-of-life experiences that shaped your preferences. Having these conversations with your family and your healthcare power of attorney agent before formalizing your living will ensures that everyone understands your wishes and the reasoning behind them."},{"title":"Draft Your Declaration","content":"You can use the statutory form provided in the Illinois Living Will Act (755 ILCS 35/3) or a customized form that addresses your specific wishes. The statutory form is legally sufficient but relatively basic. Many estate planning attorneys recommend a more detailed directive that addresses specific treatment categories individually, provides guidance for situations not covered by the statutory language, and incorporates your personal values and priorities."},{"title":"Sign the Declaration in the Presence of Two Witnesses","content":"Illinois law requires the living will to be signed by the declarant (you) and witnessed by two adults. The witnesses must be at least 18 years old, must not be the person designated to make healthcare decisions for you, and should not be your attending physician or an employee of your attending physician. While Illinois does not require notarization for a living will, having it notarized adds an additional layer of authentication that can prevent challenges."},{"title":"Distribute Copies to Key Individuals","content":"Provide copies of your living will to your attending physician (for inclusion in your medical record), your healthcare power of attorney agent, your spouse or partner, your adult children or other close family members, and any hospital or care facility where you receive treatment. Keep the original in a safe but accessible location\u2014not in a safe deposit box, which may be difficult to access in an emergency."},{"title":"Register with the Illinois Advance Directive Registry (Optional)","content":"The Illinois Secretary of State maintains an Advance Directive Registry that stores electronic copies of your living will and healthcare power of attorney. Healthcare providers can access the registry 24/7 to verify your directives. Registration is free and provides an additional safeguard that your wishes will be available when needed, especially in emergency situations when paper copies may not be immediately accessible."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Living Will vs. Other Advance Directives in Illinois","level":2,"id":"living-will-vs-others"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Illinois recognizes several types of advance directives, each serving a different purpose. Understanding how they work together helps you create comprehensive healthcare planning documents."},{"type":"comparison-table","headers":["Document","Purpose","When It Takes Effect","Scope of Authority"],"rows":[{"label":"Living Will (Declaration)","values":["Specifies treatment wishes for end-of-life situations","Terminal condition or permanent unconsciousness + inability to communicate","Limited to life-sustaining treatment decisions as specified"]},{"label":"Healthcare Power of Attorney","values":["Designates an agent to make healthcare decisions","Any situation where you cannot make or communicate decisions","Broad\u2014covers all healthcare decisions unless specifically limited"]},{"label":"POLST Form","values":["Creates actionable medical orders honored by emergency personnel","Immediately upon completion (active medical orders)","Specific treatments: CPR, intubation, antibiotics, artificial nutrition"]},{"label":"Mental Health Treatment Declaration","values":["Specifies preferences for mental health treatment","During psychiatric crisis when you cannot make decisions","Limited to mental health treatment decisions"]},{"label":"HIPAA Authorization","values":["Allows designated individuals to access medical information","Immediately upon execution","Access to protected health information only\u2014not treatment decisions"]}]},{"type":"callout","variant":"tip","title":"The Recommended Approach: Use Multiple Documents Together","content":"The most comprehensive approach is to have all applicable advance directives in place: a living will for end-of-life treatment preferences, a <a href=\"/chicago-healthcare-directives-lawyer\">healthcare power of attorney</a> for a designated decision-maker, a <a href=\"/glossary/hipaa-authorization\">HIPAA authorization</a> for information access, and a POLST form (if you have a serious illness or are elderly) for emergency medical orders. These documents work together to ensure your wishes are known and followed in every possible scenario. An experienced estate planning attorney can help you create a coordinated set of advance directives."},{"type":"heading","content":"Revoking or Changing Your Living Will","level":2,"id":"revoking-changing"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"You can revoke or change your living will at any time, as long as you are competent to do so. Illinois law provides several methods of revocation:"},{"type":"accordion","items":[{"title":"Written Revocation","content":"You can revoke your living will by executing a written revocation signed and dated by you. The written revocation should be provided to everyone who has a copy of the original declaration, including your physician, healthcare agent, family members, and any care facility. This is the most formal and clearly documented method of revocation."},{"title":"Oral Revocation","content":"You can revoke your living will by orally stating your intention to revoke it to your attending physician or other healthcare provider. The revocation becomes effective upon communication and should be documented in your medical record. While oral revocation is legally valid, it can be more difficult to verify and communicate to all relevant parties. If possible, follow up with a written revocation."},{"title":"Physical Destruction","content":"Tearing, burning, or otherwise destroying the physical document constitutes revocation. However, this method only destroys the copy in your possession\u2014other copies may still exist with physicians, family members, or in the Advance Directive Registry. Physical destruction should be accompanied by written notice to all holders of copies."},{"title":"Executing a New Declaration","content":"Creating a new living will that conflicts with the previous one effectively revokes the earlier document. The new declaration should explicitly state that it replaces all prior living wills. Always date your living will so the most recent version can be easily identified."}]},{"type":"callout","variant":"warning","title":"Verbal Wishes May Override a Living Will","content":"Under Illinois law, if you are conscious and able to communicate, your direct verbal instructions to your healthcare providers take precedence over your written living will, even if your verbal wishes contradict the document. This means that if you change your mind about treatment while conscious and competent, your doctors must follow your current wishes regardless of what your living will says. However, once you can no longer communicate, the written declaration controls."},{"type":"heading","content":"Common Questions About Illinois Living Wills","level":2,"id":"common-questions"},{"type":"accordion","items":[{"title":"Will my living will be honored if I am in an accident in another state?","content":"Most states have reciprocity provisions that honor advance directives from other states, and the Uniform Rights of the Terminally Ill Act provides a general framework for interstate recognition. However, there is no absolute guarantee. If you travel frequently or spend significant time in another state (such as seasonal residents), consider executing advance directives that comply with both states\u2019 laws. Many people maintain a set of advance directives for each state where they spend significant time."},{"title":"Can my family override my living will?","content":"Generally, no. Your living will expresses <strong>your</strong> legally binding wishes, and healthcare providers who follow your directive in good faith are protected from liability under Illinois law. However, disputes can arise if family members disagree with your directive or question its validity. Clear communication with your family about your wishes, proper execution of the document, and designation of a healthcare power of attorney agent who will advocate for your choices all help minimize the risk of family interference."},{"title":"Does a living will mean I won\u2019t receive any medical care?","content":"Absolutely not. A living will only addresses <strong>life-sustaining treatment</strong> in terminal or permanently unconscious conditions. You will continue to receive all other medical care, including comfort care, pain management, hygiene, and emotional support. The purpose is not to deny care but to prevent unwanted prolongation of dying when there is no reasonable hope of recovery."},{"title":"Do I need a lawyer to create a living will?","content":"Illinois law does not require an attorney to create a living will. You can use the statutory form and complete it yourself. However, an <a href=\"/chicago-healthcare-directives-lawyer\">experienced estate planning attorney</a> can help you understand the implications of each choice, customize the document to address your specific wishes, ensure the document is properly executed and distributed, and coordinate your living will with your other advance directives and estate planning documents. Given the critical nature of end-of-life decisions, professional guidance is strongly recommended."},{"title":"What if my doctor refuses to follow my living will?","content":"Under the Illinois Living Will Act, a physician who is unable or unwilling to comply with a patient\u2019s declaration must take all reasonable steps to transfer the patient\u2019s care to another physician who will honor the directive. The transferring physician must continue to provide care until the transfer is completed. A physician who fails to comply with the act or to arrange a transfer may be subject to professional discipline."},{"title":"How does a living will interact with organ donation wishes?","content":"If you wish to be an organ donor, your living will should be coordinated with your donation preferences. In some cases, life-sustaining treatment may need to continue temporarily to preserve organ viability for transplantation. Your living will can include language acknowledging this and authorizing temporary continuation of treatment solely for the purpose of organ donation. Discuss this with your attorney and your healthcare agent to ensure your documents are consistent."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Illinois POLST: An Important Companion to Your Living Will","level":2,"id":"polst-companion"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <strong>Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)</strong> form is a medical order (not a legal directive) that translates your end-of-life wishes into actionable orders recognized by all healthcare providers, including paramedics and emergency responders. Unlike a living will, which requires interpretation, a POLST provides clear, immediately actionable instructions about CPR, intubation, antibiotics, artificial nutrition, and other treatments."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A POLST is typically recommended for individuals with serious illness, advanced frailty, or limited life expectancy, rather than for healthy adults. The form must be completed in consultation with your physician and signed by both you (or your healthcare agent) and your physician. The POLST is printed on a distinctive bright-colored form and should be kept readily accessible (often on the refrigerator or near the front door) so that emergency personnel can find it quickly."},{"type":"key-takeaway","title":"Illinois Living Will: Essential Points","points":["A living will directs healthcare providers to withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment if you have a terminal condition or are permanently unconscious and cannot communicate","The document must be signed by you and witnessed by two adults; notarization is recommended but not required","A living will only takes effect when you have a qualifying medical condition and cannot communicate your own decisions\u2014your verbal wishes always take precedence when you can speak","Living wills work best when combined with a healthcare power of attorney, HIPAA authorization, and (if appropriate) a POLST form","Distribute copies to your physician, healthcare agent, family members, and care facilities; consider registering with the Illinois Advance Directive Registry","Review and update your living will periodically and after any significant health changes or shifts in your values and preferences","You can revoke your living will at any time through written, oral, or physical destruction methods"]},{"type":"heading","content":"Create Your Living Will Today","level":2,"id":"create-today"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Creating a living will is one of the most important steps you can take to ensure your medical wishes are honored and to relieve your loved ones of the burden of making difficult decisions without guidance. While no one enjoys contemplating end-of-life scenarios, having clear documentation of your preferences provides peace of mind for both you and your family."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Our firm helps Illinois residents create comprehensive advance directive packages that include living wills, <a href=\"/chicago-healthcare-directives-lawyer\">healthcare powers of attorney</a>, HIPAA authorizations, and other documents tailored to your specific values and circumstances. We take the time to explain each option, answer your questions, and ensure your documents are properly executed and distributed. <a href=\"/book-consultation/\">Schedule a consultation</a> to discuss your advance care planning needs and take this critical step toward protecting yourself and your family."}]'
