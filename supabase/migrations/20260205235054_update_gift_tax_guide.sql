SET content = '[{"type":"paragraph","content":"Strategic gifting is one of the most effective ways to reduce your taxable estate, minimize estate taxes, and transfer wealth to the people and causes you care about. While the federal gift tax may sound intimidating, understanding the rules reveals powerful opportunities for tax-free transfers that can save your family hundreds of thousands of dollars. For Illinois residents, gifting strategies are particularly important because of the state\u2019s relatively low $4 million estate tax exemption. This guide explains how the gift tax works, the key exclusions and exemptions available, and practical strategies to incorporate gifting into your overall estate plan."},{"type":"heading","content":"Understanding the Federal Gift Tax","level":2,"id":"understanding-gift-tax"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The federal gift tax is a tax on the transfer of property from one person (the donor) to another (the donee) when the donor receives less than full value in return. The tax exists primarily to prevent people from giving away their entire estate before death to avoid estate tax. However, Congress has built in generous exclusions and exemptions that allow significant tax-free gifting when used strategically."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"It is important to understand that the <strong>donor</strong>\u2014the person making the gift\u2014is responsible for paying any gift tax due. The recipient never owes gift tax on a gift received. In practice, very few people actually pay gift tax because of the annual exclusion and lifetime exemption, but reporting requirements still apply for gifts exceeding the annual exclusion amount."},{"type":"callout","variant":"info","title":"Illinois Does Not Impose a Separate Gift Tax","content":"Unlike the estate tax, Illinois does not have its own gift tax. All gift tax rules are federal. However, gifts made during your lifetime directly reduce your Illinois taxable estate because the gifted assets are no longer part of your estate at death. This makes lifetime gifting one of the most straightforward ways to reduce Illinois estate tax exposure for estates near or above the $4 million threshold."},{"type":"heading","content":"Annual Gift Tax Exclusion","level":2,"id":"annual-exclusion"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The annual gift tax exclusion is the cornerstone of most gifting strategies. Under current law, you can give up to <strong>$19,000 per recipient per year</strong> (2025 amount, adjusted annually for inflation) without triggering any gift tax consequences whatsoever. These gifts do not count against your lifetime exemption, do not need to be reported to the IRS, and are not included in your taxable estate."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The annual exclusion applies per donor, per recipient. This means a married couple can combine their exclusions to give <strong>$38,000 per year</strong> to each recipient through a technique called <em>gift splitting</em>. When gift splitting, one spouse can make the entire gift, but both spouses must consent (by filing a gift tax return) to treat the gift as made equally by both. The potential for wealth transfer through annual exclusion gifts is substantial when applied consistently over time to multiple recipients."},{"type":"tabs","title":"Annual Exclusion Gifting Examples","items":[{"label":"Single Donor","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> Maria is a widow with an estate valued at $5.5 million. She has three adult children and five grandchildren.<br><br><strong>Annual capacity:</strong> Maria can give $19,000 to each of her 8 descendants, totaling <strong>$152,000 per year</strong> in tax-free gifts.<br><br><strong>5-year impact:</strong> Over five years, Maria transfers $760,000 out of her estate, reducing it from $5.5 million to approximately $4.74 million. Combined with other strategies, this could help bring her estate below the $4 million Illinois estate tax threshold, potentially saving over $100,000 in state estate tax."},{"label":"Married Couple","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> James and Patricia have a combined estate of $7 million. They have four children and eight grandchildren, plus four children\u2019s spouses.<br><br><strong>Annual capacity:</strong> Using gift splitting, they can give $38,000 to each of their 16 recipients, totaling <strong>$608,000 per year</strong> in tax-free gifts.<br><br><strong>5-year impact:</strong> Over five years, James and Patricia transfer $3.04 million out of their combined estate, reducing it from $7 million to approximately $3.96 million. This eliminates Illinois estate tax entirely and reduces each spouse\u2019s estate well below the $4 million exemption."},{"label":"Gifts to Minors","content":"<strong>Scenario:</strong> Robert and Susan want to build college funds for their three grandchildren (ages 2, 5, and 8).<br><br><strong>Options:</strong> They can gift $38,000 per year per grandchild ($114,000 total annually) to custodial accounts (UTMA/UGMA), 529 education savings plans, or trusts for minors. For 529 plans specifically, they can front-load <strong>five years\u2019 worth</strong> of gifts in a single year ($190,000 per grandchild from a married couple), though they cannot make additional annual exclusion gifts to those grandchildren during the five-year period.<br><br><strong>Impact:</strong> If they front-load 529 contributions, they immediately transfer $570,000 out of their estate while providing substantial college funding for their grandchildren."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Lifetime Gift Tax Exemption","level":2,"id":"lifetime-exemption"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Beyond the annual exclusion, every individual has a <strong>lifetime gift tax exemption</strong> that allows them to make additional tax-free gifts during their lifetime. As of 2025, this exemption is approximately <strong>$13.99 million per person</strong> ($27.98 million for a married couple). This is a unified exemption\u2014it is shared between lifetime gifts and the estate tax exemption at death. Every dollar of lifetime exemption used for gifts reduces the amount available to shelter your estate from federal estate tax at death."},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For most Illinois residents, the federal lifetime exemption is far more than they will ever need. However, the exemption is scheduled to decrease significantly at the end of 2025 when the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) provisions sunset. Without congressional action, the exemption will revert to approximately <strong>$7 million per person</strong> (adjusted for inflation). This potential change makes 2025 a particularly important year for individuals who want to make large lifetime gifts while the higher exemption is available."},{"type":"callout","variant":"warning","title":"Scheduled Exemption Decrease in 2026","content":"The current $13.99 million federal gift and estate tax exemption is temporary. Unless Congress extends the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provisions, the exemption will drop to approximately $7 million per person in 2026. The IRS has confirmed that gifts made under the higher exemption will <strong>not</strong> be clawed back even if the exemption decreases\u2014this is often called the \u201canti-clawback\u201d rule. This creates a use-it-or-lose-it opportunity for individuals with sufficient wealth to make large gifts before the sunset."},{"type":"heading","content":"Gifts Not Subject to Gift Tax","level":2,"id":"tax-free-gifts"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Several categories of transfers are completely exempt from the gift tax and do not count against either the annual exclusion or the lifetime exemption. Understanding these exemptions expands your ability to transfer wealth tax-free."},{"type":"accordion","items":[{"title":"Direct Payments for Education (Tuition)","content":"Payments made <strong>directly to an educational institution</strong> for another person\u2019s tuition are exempt from gift tax with no dollar limit. The key requirements are that the payment must be made directly to the school (not to the student), and it covers tuition only\u2014not room, board, books, supplies, or other expenses. This exemption can be used in addition to the annual exclusion gift. For example, you could pay $60,000 in tuition directly to a university for your grandchild <em>and</em> give them an additional $19,000 annual exclusion gift in the same year, all tax-free."},{"title":"Direct Payments for Medical Expenses","content":"Payments made <strong>directly to a medical care provider</strong> for another person\u2019s medical expenses are exempt from gift tax with no dollar limit. This includes payments for medical procedures, hospital bills, health insurance premiums, dental care, and other qualified medical expenses. Like the tuition exemption, the payment must go directly to the provider, not to the individual. This exemption is particularly valuable for helping elderly parents, adult children with significant medical needs, or anyone facing large healthcare costs."},{"title":"Gifts to a Spouse","content":"The <strong>unlimited marital deduction</strong> allows unlimited tax-free gifts between U.S. citizen spouses. There is no annual limit, no lifetime limit, and no reporting requirement. However, if your spouse is not a U.S. citizen, a special annual exclusion of $190,000 (2025 amount, indexed for inflation) applies instead of the unlimited deduction. Gifts to a non-citizen spouse exceeding this amount count against the lifetime exemption."},{"title":"Gifts to Qualified Charities","content":"Gifts to qualified charitable organizations are exempt from gift tax and are also deductible for income tax purposes (subject to limitations). Charitable gifts do not count against the annual exclusion or lifetime exemption. Charitable giving can be combined with estate planning through vehicles like <strong>charitable remainder trusts</strong>, <strong>charitable lead trusts</strong>, and <strong>donor-advised funds</strong> to achieve both philanthropic and tax reduction goals."},{"title":"Gifts to Political Organizations","content":"Contributions to political organizations as defined under IRC Section 527 are exempt from gift tax. This includes contributions to political parties, political action committees (PACs), and campaign committees. There are separate campaign finance limits, but these are not related to the gift tax rules."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Gift Tax Reporting Requirements","level":2,"id":"reporting-requirements"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Even when no gift tax is owed, certain gifts must be reported to the IRS on <strong>Form 709</strong> (United States Gift and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Return). Understanding when filing is required helps you stay compliant and properly track your use of the lifetime exemption."},{"type":"numbered-steps","items":[{"title":"Determine If a Taxable Gift Was Made","content":"A taxable gift occurs whenever you transfer property to someone for less than full and adequate consideration, and the transfer does not qualify for the annual exclusion, marital deduction, charitable deduction, or educational/medical exclusions. If all gifts to a single recipient in a calendar year are within the annual exclusion amount ($19,000 in 2025), no filing is required for that recipient."},{"title":"File Form 709 If Required","content":"Form 709 is due on <strong>April 15</strong> of the year following the year the gift was made (the same deadline as your income tax return). You can request an automatic extension by filing Form 4868 (the income tax extension), which extends the gift tax return deadline to October 15. Married couples who elect gift splitting must <strong>both</strong> file Form 709 even if only one spouse made the gift."},{"title":"Track Your Lifetime Exemption Usage","content":"Each Form 709 filed tracks your cumulative use of the lifetime gift tax exemption. The IRS maintains this running total, and the remaining exemption amount is applied to your estate at death when calculating the federal estate tax. Accurate record-keeping is essential to ensure your estate planning attorney and executor have complete information when the time comes."},{"title":"Retain Records of All Gifts","content":"Keep detailed records of all gifts, including the date, recipient, description and value of the property, any conditions or restrictions, and copies of appraisals for hard-to-value assets. These records should be maintained with your estate planning documents and shared with your executor and estate planning attorney."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Gifting Strategies for Illinois Estate Tax Reduction","level":2,"id":"gifting-strategies-illinois"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"For Illinois residents with estates near or above the $4 million state estate tax threshold, systematic gifting programs are among the most effective and straightforward tax reduction strategies available. Here are specific approaches tailored to Illinois estate tax planning."},{"type":"heading","content":"Annual Exclusion Gifting Program","level":3,"id":"annual-exclusion-program"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"A disciplined annual gifting program is the foundation of most estate tax reduction plans. By making full use of the annual exclusion each year, you can transfer substantial wealth out of your taxable estate without any gift tax consequences or reduction of your lifetime exemption. The key is consistency and starting early\u2014the longer you maintain the program, the greater the cumulative reduction in your estate."},{"type":"heading","content":"529 Plan Superfunding","level":3,"id":"529-superfunding"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"Illinois offers the Bright Start 529 College Savings Program, which provides state income tax deductions for contributions and tax-free growth for qualified education expenses. The gift tax rules allow you to front-load five years of annual exclusion gifts into a 529 plan in a single year. For 2025, this means an individual can contribute up to $95,000 (5 x $19,000) or a married couple can contribute up to $190,000 per beneficiary in one year. This strategy immediately removes these assets from your taxable estate while providing significant educational funding for your beneficiaries."},{"type":"heading","content":"Gifts of Appreciating Assets","level":3,"id":"gifts-appreciating-assets"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"When possible, gift assets that are likely to appreciate in value rather than cash. By transferring appreciating assets now, all future appreciation occurs outside your taxable estate. For example, gifting shares in a growing business, real estate with development potential, or investments expected to increase in value transfers not only the current value but all future growth to the recipient. The gift tax value is based on the asset\u2019s value at the time of the gift, regardless of how much it appreciates afterward."},{"type":"callout","variant":"tip","title":"Combine Strategies for Maximum Impact","content":"The most effective gifting plans combine multiple strategies. For example, a married couple with an estate of $6 million might implement annual exclusion gifts to children and grandchildren ($200,000+ per year), front-load 529 plans for grandchildren ($570,000 immediate transfer), pay tuition directly for college-age grandchildren (unlimited), make charitable contributions ($50,000+ per year), and gift appreciating business interests to children through a family LLC. Within 3\u20135 years, this comprehensive approach could reduce their combined estate well below the $4 million Illinois threshold, saving potentially $300,000 or more in state estate tax."},{"type":"heading","content":"Common Gifting Mistakes to Avoid","level":2,"id":"common-mistakes"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"While gifting is a powerful estate planning tool, mistakes can result in unintended tax consequences, family conflicts, or loss of financial security. Avoid these common pitfalls:"},{"type":"accordion","items":[{"title":"Giving Away Too Much Too Soon","content":"The most critical mistake is gifting assets you may need for your own living expenses, healthcare costs, or long-term care. No tax savings is worth compromising your financial security. Before implementing a gifting program, work with your financial advisor to ensure you retain sufficient assets to maintain your lifestyle and cover potential future expenses, including inflation, market downturns, and healthcare costs. A good rule of thumb is to gift only from assets that are clearly surplus to your projected lifetime needs."},{"title":"Gifting Highly Appreciated Assets to the Wrong Recipients","content":"When you gift appreciated property, the recipient inherits your <strong>cost basis</strong> (what you originally paid for it). If they later sell the asset, they owe capital gains tax on the difference between your original cost and the sale price. In contrast, assets inherited at death receive a <strong>stepped-up basis</strong> to their fair market value at the date of death, eliminating all capital gains tax on the appreciation. For highly appreciated assets, it may be more tax-efficient to hold them until death so your beneficiaries receive the stepped-up basis. Gift low-basis assets only when the estate tax savings clearly outweigh the lost step-up benefit."},{"title":"Failing to File Gift Tax Returns","content":"Even when no tax is owed, failing to file Form 709 for gifts exceeding the annual exclusion starts the statute of limitations clock and creates a paper trail of your lifetime exemption usage. If you die without having properly reported lifetime gifts, your executor may face challenges proving how much exemption remains available. Additionally, the IRS can assess gift tax at any time for unreported gifts because the statute of limitations never begins to run without a filed return."},{"title":"Making Gifts with Strings Attached","content":"If you make a gift but retain too much control over the asset\u2014such as continuing to use gifted property, maintaining the right to take it back, or controlling how the recipient uses it\u2014the IRS may treat the gift as incomplete or include the asset in your taxable estate under the \u201cretained interest\u201d rules. For a gift to be effective for tax purposes, you must relinquish dominion and control. This is one reason why irrevocable trusts are often preferred over outright gifts for significant transfers: the trust structure provides clear separation while still allowing some indirect benefits through trust terms."},{"title":"Ignoring Medicaid Look-Back Rules","content":"If you may need Medicaid assistance for long-term care in the future, be aware that gifts made within <strong>five years</strong> of applying for Medicaid benefits can result in a penalty period during which you are ineligible for benefits. This \u201clook-back\u201d period applies to most gifts and transfers for less than fair market value. Gifting strategies and Medicaid planning must be carefully coordinated, as aggressive gifting can leave you without resources and without government assistance."}]},{"type":"heading","content":"Gift Tax and Generation-Skipping Transfers","level":2,"id":"generation-skipping"},{"type":"paragraph","content":"The <strong>generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax</strong> is an additional tax that applies to gifts and bequests that skip a generation\u2014for example, gifts from grandparents directly to grandchildren (or to trusts for their benefit) when the grandparents\u2019 children are still alive. The GST tax is imposed at a flat rate equal to the highest federal estate tax rate (currently 40%) in addition to any gift or estate tax. However, every individual has a GST tax exemption equal to the federal estate tax exemption ($13.99 million in 2025). Gifts within the annual exclusion amount ($19,000 per recipient) and direct payments for tuition or medical expenses are generally exempt from the GST tax.
